            <p><title>Gibraltar. Nov. 19th. 1894. Monday. </title></p>
            <p>We arrived this morning – dropping our anchor
            about 12 o’-clock – having sailed from <placeName ref="#New_York">New York</placeName> on the <name type="boat">Fulda</name> at 3 o’clock on the
            afternoon of the 10th. For the first time on the Atlantic I was really ill – and for two
            days kept to my berth and room – the voyage seemed endless. We had pleasant weather, but
            a tremendous following sea – but the <name type="boat">Fulda</name> proved a very steady sea boat – she was clean
            – the service at table very poor – and on the last morning as I looked at my berth, I
            felt, whatever life might have before me, thankful that there was not another night
            there. The steamer was uncomfortably crowded, with the most unobjectionable lot of
            passengers I had ever seen. At our little table we had some pleasant Westchester Co.
            people with whom we made friends. After two or three days out, we discovered the 2d
            class deck, which was big and unencumbered, except with 3 of the most amusing parrots it
            has ever been my good fortune to meet. There were no second class passengers – so we had
            our chairs carried down there, and lived there the rest of the voyage, quite to
            ourselves. We came to the Hotel Royal where we stayed with <persName ref="#Wilson_Charlie">Charlie</persName> and <persName ref="#Wilson_Eleanor">Nellie Wilson</persName>
            seven years ago – and are fairly comfortable. We start tomorrow on a pilgrimage to
            <placeName ref="#Madrid">Madrid</placeName>, to see its great pictures – and <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> has asked a young man, a fellow
            passenger, whom he has talked to a good deal and become interested in, to go with us. We
            drove out to see some races this afternoon, as we will have one or two days here on our
            way back, to show <persName ref="#Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> the island.</p>

            <p><title>Madrid. Spain. Nov. 26.</title></p>
            <p> We left <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> on the
            morning of the 20th at 8 o’clock – going by boat for half and hour to the Spanish
            frontier – where we were rather roughly handled in the Custom House. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> lost a lot
            of cigarettes – and the only thing that saved his boxes of favorite cigars was the word
            Spain branded on the boxes. They dove to the bottom of my trunk and hauled out my case
            of homeopathic medicines – and had a solemn pow-wow over it. Then they seized my camera
            that <persName ref="#Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> was carrying – insisted on having the case opened, and were too much afraid
            of taking out the camera themselves. I took it out – took off the cap and pointed the
            thing at them – to their manifest alarm – for they hurriedly motioned to put it back
            safely in its case. Then they fell upon a stout little basket I was carrying, filled
            with my various bottles – drew all of them out, and came upon a big bottle of glycerine
            which they turned over and over, and as it looked like something good to drink, I was in
            hopes they would try it. I would gladly have sacrificed a cherished bottle of glycerine
            for the pleasure of seeing them choking over it. The English have recently built a fine
            railway from <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> to <placeName ref="#Cordova">Cordova</placeName> connecting with the other Spanish lines – thus
            releasing <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> from her isolated position. We had a comfortable ride to <placeName ref="#Cordova">Cordova</placeName> –
            through generally dreary, vast, waste country, except for the olive orchards. We were
            almost an hour late, and our train from <placeName ref="#Seville">Seville</placeName>, in the wagon lit of which we had 2
            compartments engaged, was already in. However we had more than 15 minutes, so our
            luggage was scuttled into the booking office, where to our consternation <pb n="3"/> we were told
            that they never booked luggage so late. Nothing would move them, and we stood staring
            indignantly at our train, until it moved off for <placeName ref="#Madrid"> Madrid </placeName>. We said some bad words and
            commented satirically on the method of running railways in <country ref="#Spain">Spain </country>, where passengers seem
            to be incidental factors – but the officials’ feelings did not seem to be wounded, so,
            making the best of the business, we drove to the Hotel where we stayed day 7 years ago –
            and the next morning walked to the Mosque or Cathedral, and then afterwards to the
            little plaza near for a view of the bridge across the Guadalquiver, the foundations of
            which are Roman and the rest Moorish. A promising era seems to have set in for the
            Mosque – for many of the built up arches are being restored – the stuff added in later
            and Christian times carted away, and the beautiful Moorish arches, ornaments and
            paintings opened up once more. But I am afraid that the Cathedral itself, which so
            obstructs and ruins the wonderful perspective effect of the arches, and all the tawdry
            altars which intrude themselves everywhere will never be done away with. One exquisitely
            beautiful portion, called the place of the Kalefs has been entirely opened up since we
            were here last – and the decorations and colour are quite perfect, and the tiles quite
            marvelous. We left at 2:30 in the afternoon for <placeName ref="#Madrid">Madrid</placeName> – <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName>, <persName ref="Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I having
            what is called a Berlina, where were 3 beds on reclining chairs – while <persName ref="#Palsley_Mr">Mr. Palsley</persName> and
            <persName ref="Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> were in another. We were fairly comfortable – though the ancient smell that
            pervaded the cavities from which our coffin-like beds were pulled rather weighed upon my
            senses. At last, sleeping very soundly, I was awakened by <pb n="4"/> a rush of cold air, and saw
            <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> sitting up staring at some porters who were jabbering Spanish to us,
            and we at last perceived that we had arrived at <placeName ref="#Madrid">Madrid</placeName>, so we scuttled into our things
            as best we could – and in the cold light of early dawn drove to our hotel, I with boots
            unbuttoned and no gloves, and our pockets stuffed with soap dishes, tooth brushes etc.
            After having made our toilets and eaten a hot breakfast, we took ourselves off to the
            Museo – incomparable as I knew it to be, I never before realized how much so. Aside from
            the wonderful Velasquezs there are adorable Raphael’s and the most perfect Titians I
            have ever seen. His equestrian portrait of <persName ref="#Charles_V">Charles V</persName> and the standing portrait – the
            portrait of the hateful <persName ref="#Philip_II">Philip II</persName> – Adam and Eve – Entombment – and a host of others.
            The most adorable little cabinet picture of the Holy Family by Raphael – 2 delightful
            portraits of Parmigiano and Holy Family - a Giorgione, and one treasure after another –
            until it was quite bewildering. We came away at one o’clock quite congealed with cold.
            The next day, <persName ref="Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName>  and Lapsley, <persName ref="Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> and a valet de place made an early start for
            <placeName ref="#Toledo">Toledo</placeName>. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> spent the morning at the gallery, and came home in a maze of delight –
            and I not feeling very well sat by the fire and wrote letters. The next day the rest
            went to the Escorial – <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and I spent 3 hours at the Gallery – and yesterday being
            Sunday, we all went to the gallery in the morning. <persName ref="Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I to drive in the
            afternoon – <pb n="5"/> the rest to a bull fight! We found the royal park distinctly depressing –
            limited, badly cared for, wretchedly planted – afterwards we drove to the great park –
            but were so cold and tired we could not enjoy anything and came home wondering at the
            crowds of people in the Park, and in the streets, and if anywhere in the big city of
            <placeName ref="#Madrid">Madrid</placeName> there could be anybody left in a house. We got off at 6 tonight for <placeName ref="#Seville">Seville</placeName>.
            <persName ref="Jones_Daniel">Jones</persName> is packing – and we take our last afternoon at the gallery. </p>

            <p>We had a most uncomfortable ride to <placeName ref="#Seville">Seville</placeName> the other night – arriving about 10 in the
            morning. Went to the Hotel de Madrid, and were shown to the very rooms we occupied 7
            years ago, with <persName ref="#Wilson_Charlie">Charlie</persName> and <persName ref="#Wilson_Eleanor">Nellie</persName>. After breakfast went to the Cathedral, where we were
            not allowed to put our heads in hardly – as the whole great structure was filled with
            scaffolding and mighty supports. Soon after we were last there, one of the great central
            piers toppled over one night – and the whole edifice on examination was found so
            unsettled by various earthquakes that a mighty restoration was necessary. In the
            afternoon a short visit to the almost uninteresting gallery, and to the Caradid
            hospital, and then to the Aleazar, and a last peep into the Cathedral in the gloom of
            the evening, brought us back to the hotel in time for tea – and we lamented, at least
            <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and I, that time and money had been wasted in <placeName ref="#Seville">Seville</placeName>. A start the next morning
            at 10, and a long railway ride to <placeName ref="#Granada">Granada</placeName> which we reached at 8:30 in the evening, <pb n="6"/> very
            tired and a long ride up to this hotel in the Alhambra grounds. Today it has rained. I
            have stayed in doors. The hotel is almost empty – a stray American or two – and 2
            pleasant English people. The former name Biete Suelos, which it carried when we were
            here before, has been changed into Hotel de Roma – it is much the same thing however –
            with a little freshening in the way of paint and paper – but far from luxurious – the
            table the best thing about it. Our rooms are small and dark and not cheerful. </p>

            <p><title>Cairo. Shepheards Hotel. Dec. 21st. </title></p>
            <p>It seems a great stretch of time since I last wrote
            anything, and the days have been inexpressibly long and tiresome. The cold that I began
            to take in the chill <placeName ref="#Madrid">Madrid</placeName> gallery grew worse and worse, and I am still in its
            clutches. We stayed three days at <placeName ref="#Granada">Granada</placeName> – and it rained more or less all the time – it
            was not cold, except in the house and in our dreary little sitting room, overhung by the
            weeping and dripping trees, with the perpetual sound of a little splashing fountain
            below, it was too gloomy to be brightened by the tiny stove, that only smoked and never
            burned – our bedrooms were very damp. We left for <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> on Sunday Dec. On the 5
            o’clock train, which made it necessary to be called at a quarter to 4, in order to
            dress, breakfast, and drive the long distance to the station. <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and Mr. Lapsley
            breakfasted down stairs – but <persName ref="Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I took our wretched little meal of bad coffee,
            bad eggs and butter in our melancholy sitting <pb n="7"/> room by the light of the lamp. It seemed
            quite in the middle of the night when we got into the omnibus and there was an air of
            flight or secret adventure in it. We had some time to wait in the draughty station – and
            then <persName ref="Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> and I had a Berlina to ourselves, in consideration of my ailing throat, and
            the necessary amount of tobacco smoke <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="#Lapsley_Mr">Lapsley</persName> had to manufacture. So we
            smuggled down in our corners, and went promptly to sleep. At 10 o’clock we reached
            Bobadilla, where we breakfasted and changed cars. As the day wore on the wind became
            very cold and violent – our speed was anywhere from 8-10 miles an hour. We arrived at
            Algemesi after dark in a pouring rain to learn that no boat had been running from
            <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gibraltar</placeName> because of the storm, for 3 days. We were plunged into instant despair, when
            we were accosted by a pleasant friendly voice in English which explained to us that its
            owner was the Gen. Sup. of the English R.R. – and he kindly invited us to his rooms near
            by until some place could be found for the night. The pleasant sitting room looked most
            cheerful – and he gave me a glass of wine and a biscuit – and we warmed and dried
            ourselves before getting into the curious little affair on wheels called a carriage –
            <persName ref="#Johnson_Mr">Mr. Johnson</persName> too, kindly sent one of his men, speaking both English and Spanish with us.
            The first hotel to which we went had only 2 rooms to give us. Then we went to another,
            where we found all the rooms we wanted – very clean and almost comfortable – and we were
            thankful to get a really good dinner, and go to bed. It was kept by an old man, with a
            large family of sons and daughters, who were the servants of the house. The next morning
            after breakfast we drove back <pb n="8"/> to the station, uncertain whether the boat would come over
            from <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gib.</placeName> or if we would be obliged to go back for 2 stations on the R.R. and drive for
            3 hours to Gib. Again <persName ref="#Johnson_Mr">Mr. Johnson</persName> came to our aid, and took us to his rooms, until we
            heard the boat was coming, where we sat for an hour – he and Theodore talking about
            building railways – and he showed us a huge book of photographs that he had taken of the
            road in its various phases – and told us of the special difficulties they encountered
            from <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gib.</placeName> to <placeName ref="#Cordova">Cordova</placeName>. Then we went out to the pier which extends some distance – and
            found that some of it was quite covered with water – the waves breaking from time to
            time over it. Our little steamer lay some distance out, bobbing up and down on the rough
            water, and there were 2 small boats to take us and our luggage out. So we waded in some
            places ankle deep in water, and then we plumped into the boat which was dripping with
            water, and lifting on the waves in a most unpleasant manner. However we finally reached
            our former rooms in the Royal Hotel in <placeName ref="#Gibraltar">Gib</placeName>, and <persName ref="#Lapsley_Mr">Mr. Lapsley</persName> said goodbye at once and
            went off to the Werra in which he was going to Genoa. The rain poured hopelessly all
            that day, and all the next, while we waited for our P. & O. steamer which was signaled
            at 4 – when I was bundled into numerous wraps, with a shawl tied over my head, put into
            a carriage, and then into a small boat, and finally landed on the deck of the Oriental
            more dead than alive – I at once went to bed and sent for the ship’s doctor – a very
            kind, dapper little man in his dinner dress, who told me to stay in bed, and gave me
            some nauseous drugs – and there I did stay for four <pb n="9"/> days, with many a cockroach to keep
            me company – our rooms were very good – the boat was crowded – every berth full – but we
            all had our rooms to ourselves. We made <country ref="#Malta">Malta</country> the evening of Friday jut at sunset and
            stopped some hour to coal – and arrived at <placeName ref="#Brindisi">Brindisi</placeName> Sunday morning. English mail – 900
            bags arrived at 10pm. But it rained most of the time and I could not be on deck. I was
            immensely bored by the whole voyage – Wednesday afternoon we sighted the Damietta light
            – and at 5 o’clock cat anchor at Port Said where we lay until midnight coaling again.
            What a scene from the Inferno it was, those black figures in the glare of the torches!
            We were all packed and ready to land as <placeName ref="#Ismailia">Ismailia</placeName> early in the morning – were called at
            4:30 – but it was after 6 before we got off in the tender. Our 3 nice English boys who
            sat at table with us were up to see us off – as well as the Doctor and with no regrets
            I looked my last at the Oriental as she steamed away to Suez. We had breakfast and a
            drive at <placeName ref="#Ismailia">Ismailia</placeName> and took the train at 1 o’clock arriving here at 5:30. Found <persName ref="#Salah_Mohammed">Mohammed</persName>
            waiting for us and gladly took possession of our pleasant rooms here. The next morning
            we drove over on the other ide of the river to inspect several dahabeahs and at last
            went to our old <name type="boat">Herodotus</name> – which we found in fine order – she having been entirely
            scraped and repainted outside and in. Our old Reis, <persName ref="#Fuli_Rais">Fooley</persName>, <persName ref="#Hassan">Hasan</persName>, and others of our old
            crew were on her – and gave us the heartiest welcome – and we felt at home there. We
            looked her carefully over, and decided to make a condition of our taking her that she
            should have new carpets – curtains etc. which Rostovitch’s agent when we saw him acceded
            to at once – and we were allowed <pb n="10"/> to choose them – and Nettie and I met the agent in the
            afternoon at Pasquale’s, a large shop here – and drove them all out of their wit because
            of our impossible tastes. Never have I seen anything so hideous in the way of carpets
            and stuffs. We at last chose not what we liked, but what was least objectionable, and
            <persName ref="#Davis_Theodore">Theodore</persName> and <persName ref="Buttles_Jeanette">Nettie</persName> report that they turn out very well. For after leaving Pasquale’s we
            drove to <persName ref="#Sandwith_Dr">Dr. Sandwith’s</persName> office, who pounded me and stethoscoped me, and said I must go
            home and stay in the house until I got better. Since then, I have stayed in two rooms,
            and the week has been long, and I find it difficult to get rid of my cough. Our rooms
            are at the front of the hotel, and overlook the street and entrance and terrace, so that
            I can stare at the amusing and ever shifting panorama and I do stand and tare, until I
            am too tired to look longer. Fortunately our sitting room and my room that opens out of
            it, have both of them open grates, and we have kept fires burning every day. The weather
            is not very good – as <persName ref="#Sandwith_Dr">Dr. Sandwith’s</persName> says “you must remember this is our rough winter
            weather”. My room is really huge – with two lofty French windows – two single lace
            canopied beds –with their very necessary mosquito nets, two enormous wardrobes – equally
            large bureau, dressing table, washstand, lounge and square table in the middle of the
            room, even with four trunks in it, it remains spacious. </p>

            <p><title>Wednesday, Dec. 26 </title></p>
            <p>We came on board the Herodotus on the 23d Sunday morning – a strong south wind had been blowing for
            days – but everything had been <pb n="11"/> ready for us for some time. I was tired of the hotel and
            we hope the south wind would soon be discouraged. But on Monday it holding as strong as
            ever, we pulled about half a mile away along the bank – and the next day Xmas, we pulled
            over to Ghizeh, and lay opposite the Museum about in the place we lay for a week on
            coming down the river last time. Theodore and Nettie rode out on donkeys to visit the
            Museum – but I am still condemned to indoors because this south wind is so strong and so
            cold. Mr. Bronson and her daughter came over again to see us and have tea. Dr. Sandwith
            came to see me the first day on board, and brought two leaves and a fruit of the Pawpaw
            tree – from which the Papoid tablets are made, that Theodore relies on so entirely. It
            is an Indian tree, and he says the native claim that if touch meat is wrapped in its
            leaves, it will become tender, but if left too long, putrid, and that the leaves are
            used in India for cooking with food to make it digestible. The fruit is not unlike our
            Ohio Pawpaw tree – but the leaf entirely unlike. I must look into the matter when I get
            home. Have been very busy getting settled. The boat looks greatly improved – and we have
            such a lot of room. I have taken Howard’s old room for my dressing room, and Nettie,
            Fielding’s old room for her dressing room – and the stern room makes a charming sitting
            room. Our new cook proves a great success. There seems no end to the variety of his
            things – and we were amazed the first morning at breakfast to have the most delicious
            waffles sent in to us. We had a quiet little Xmas – giving the men the present we had
            brought for them. Our old Captain gabbles as fast as ever – most of our old men are with
            us again – and being without drago-<pb n="12"/>man we are going to be brought in pleasanter and
            closer relations to them – we all like the feeling I think, of being without a boss.</p>

            <p>The south wind has held the whole week – and I have felt
            most impatient – Theodore and Jones go into Cairo every day – there is always some last
            thing to be bought. We left our landing this afternoon and pulled along a little way

            <p>The wind came out light from the north yesterday morning, and we got away at last under sail. It grew
            quite strong during the day, and we sailed through the night until about 6 o’clock this
            morning – I heard the men all through the night – and about one o’clock we stuck on a
            sand bank – I then got up lighted a candle, and let it burn itself out, and finally went
            to sleep. We think we made about 50 miles. But this morning there is no wind – if any,
            from the south – however by tracking and polling we made one mile today. I have been up
            on deck two or three times – finding the sun and air delicious – we have 3 big basket
            hooded chairs, all lined and trimmed – that proved to be delightful things and serve
            equally well as a protection against sun and wind. </p>

            at times, and have thus made about 10 miles in 2 days – cold and not quite clear. Have
            only been on deck a few moments today. The night are now so perfect with the young moon,
            and these magnificent heavens – the stars so near and big and bright – it is entrancing
            – we pulled up at a wide low sand bank for the night – and it was really a hardship to

            <p>Nettie and I have just had a discussion as to whether this was or was
            not Saturday. It gives on such a strange, lost feeling to be uncertain as to the days,
            with no immediate authority to appeal to. We have had rather a cold day – with fitful
            winds – we have done a good deal of slow sailing - have passed Benisoef - and are now at
            9:30pm within a short distance of Hibeh – we may have made about 10 miles. In the midst
            of a good turn of wind, we had to pull up at Benisoef, for a sailor who had been
            despatched early this morning to that town to buy some fruit and vegetables. It was
            rather vexatious – our nice big Moussa set off at once across the fields to look for the
            man and hurry him. Jones took his gun and disappeared. Then Nettie and I walked up <pb n="14"/> and
            down the hard sand inhaling the delicious air, and staring across the fields to see
            Benisoef lying back some distance on a canal amongst its palms – a large, important town
            – then the sailor appeared with is well laden basket on his head; and as the wind blew
            strongly, a sailor was sent off in haste to look for Jones – Hasan to find Theodore –
            and Mohammed flew towards the town to find Moussa – and at last they all were hauled in
            and were off. The night is magically lovely. </p>

            <p>It was very hot and calm this

            tied up for the night, both awnings were spread – and every one settled down to stay for
            the night – but about 9, as Theodore and I had finished our game of cribbage, a strong
            north wind began. The Captain waited awhile to see if it had come to stay – then the
            awnings went down, and the stake came up, and we have been bounding along ever since – I

            <p>It wasn’t a good night to sleep – what with the shifting of the sails, the orders – the running backwards and
            forwards on the deck above me, it was quite impossible – at 1 o’clock, I got up, lighted
            my candle and prowled into the saloon, and found some biscuit and a glass of port wine.
            We reached Minyeh at 2 o’clock. On our first journey up the Nile we reached Minyeh the
            2d day – on our last the 7th day. We were obliged to stop as we had ordered our mail
            sent there, and some fresh butter from the Swiss Dairy at Cairo. Jones went off with old
            Moussa to the town, coming back with a big parcel of letters and papers. Then we got
            under way, and have been sailing ever since – though Theodore has given orders that we
            shall stop at 10 o’clock. We have passed Beni <pb n="16"/> Hassan, Rodah, where we pulled up on the
            opposite side, and sent the felucca across to the town to get the ironing man for whom
            Theodore had written to Cairo for. They found him waiting, with the lot of fresh butter,
            which did not turn up at Minyeh this morning. He is a very likely looking fellow – and
            his name is Ibraim – we are so glad to have a new name. There are already so many
            Mohammeds and Hasans! While the rest were away at Rhodah, I sat down on the lower deck
            out of the wind for a few minutes – not having been out before – we had tied up
            unceremoniously at a poor fellahs garden – where onions, cucumbers and tomatoes were
            growing, carefully tended – he was a good looking fellow, who came forward in his long
            black robe, to protect his property as well as he could – we bought some tomatoes of him
            – and gave him a little money to pay for any damage we might have caused. They never
            protest against the “Howadji” in a dahabeah – and indeed the greatest damage is done by
            the troops of people who as soon as they see a dahabeah approach the land, leave all,
            and come to stare. </p>

            <p>A fair wind most of the day brought us about 8
            o’clock this <pb n="17"/> evening within two miles of Manfalout and we have calculated that we have
            made about 24 1/2 miles today. I have been on deck since 11 o’clock – that is until 5
            o’clock – at which I came below – before the first chill of the evening comes. Theodore
            and Nettie stay above until it is time to dress for dinner. It is a real hardship to
            leave such beauty abroad – and this evening it was specially tantalizing – for the scene
            was as interesting. We came to the great Gebel Aboufeydah chain early in the day. It is
            the most difficult part of the river, and the most dangerous for the great cliffs come
            sheer down to the water, and the currents are strong, and the wind shifting. Just
            opposite the beginning of these cliffs, there is a long, low island dividing the river –
            the channel next to the rocks is shorter – but the other channel is the longer and
            safer. The Stella which has again caught up with us, chose the latter and our Reis the
            former. I had to come down during the most interesting time – and there was a great row
            on deck afterwards – the sails constantly shifted – the shouting of orders – the running
            and jumping about of the sailors. One would have thought again and again that we were
            going to instant destruction. The Stella came out best – as she did not feel in her
            channel the fluctuations of the wind as we did. We have however passed ahead of her a
            little way, and are both anchored in the broad stream, where it bends straight away from
            the cliffs towards Manfalout. These cliffs, so Mr. Chester, an Englishman who had been
            coming for 20 years to Egypt for his winters told me on our first voyage up, used to be
            the home of millions of birds – which were so tame that you could row along them and
            almost <pb n="18"/> put your hand upon them in their nests – but that they were rapidly being driven
            away by the tourists and their guns. And I remember that on the first voyage Mohammed
            fired his gun, quite to my displeasure, into the air to test the echo, and frighten the
            birds and all up the great face of the cliffs, from countless holes and caves, they came
            out screaming, big and little. Yesterday, on the contrary, although we were so long
            getting past them, we only counted six birds! The Stella has 2 men on her, whose great
            pleasure consists in popping their guns at every thing – and I am daily so annoyed at
            the hateful creatures, murdering the delicious peace of the river, and trying to kill
            the few characteristic and interesting birds, that still have the courage to live on the
            Nile – that highway of tourists. </p>

            <p>We are now lying at Assiout having
            made 28 miles. I was on deck much of the day. Sometime before noon, we saw as usual the
            minaret of Assiout – but as usual were a long time reaching the town – the river makes
            such great bends below – that the distance is deluding. The wind grew very strong in the
            afternoon – too strong to make one of the great turns and we touched at the bank to let
            Jones and Ibraim go into the town for the mail and some necessary things. Our people all
            said the town was near – but poor Jones found he had a walk of 6 miles or more before
            getting into Assiout. In the meantime we tracked and sailed and after dark, pulled up
            opposite the light of the town, and sent our felucca over for the man – and now we are
            deluged with papers – American <pb n="19"/> and English – and we feel as if we must go through with
            them all. Tuesday. Jan. 15. We started out betimes this morning sailing – it must have
            been soon after 7 – and have been rattling along in fair style – past lovely shores of
            splendid palms and the most luxuriant scent trees with their soft rounded outlines – the
            air has been fragrant with the blossoming crops – fefl and gulhan. But the wind has been
            too strong for me to be out – just after tea I wrapped myself in my big cloak, and went
            on deck and stayed about 10 minutes in the hooded chair – it was too tantalizing to have
            to come down. But downstairs is not half a bad place – with the shifting scenes on
            either shore – the sunny windows – all the space to myself – for Theodore and Nettie are
            always on deck – and I have dozens of pleasant things to do – we are still (10 P.M.)
            sailing – and Jones has just been in reporting that we are within 4 or 5 miles of
            Tahtah. </p>

            <p>We pulled up to Girgeh this evening about 7 o’clock – after
            an uninterrupted sail from Asiout yesterday morning. All night long we bowled along
            steadily – and I dreamily wondered as I have wakened through the night, how weary the
            Reis and all the crew must be. The wind, grew very rough toward morning, and about 5:30
            we went bang upon a and bank with a great thump – and I did not sleep again – though we
            soon got off the sand, and careered along on our triumphant course. <pb n="20"/> We passed Sohag at
            9:30 – and Akmim half an hour after – where we saw Cooks big dahabeah the “Hathor” lying
            with her tug – she having passed us while we were lying at Ghizeh. The paper reported
            that “Lord and Lady Amherst de Hackney and their four daughters” – that they had taken
            this dahabeah and tug for 3 months and a camping equipage – and that they would make
            many excursions. They started soon after we passed them – but they could not catch us in
            the wind we had – we sailed a long distance close to the perpendicular cliffs, which
            come down quite to the water – and the setting sun made a wonderful rose color of the
            limestone – and shadows wonderfully blue. We have been going through much lovely country
            – palms – dom palms – scents and sycamores in richest profusion – and the country highly
            cultivated – it is one of the very richest provinces of Egypt. I have had to be down
            stairs all day, because of the wind. </p>

           	<p>Thursday - We have been lying
            here all day at the big low sand bank where we lay two years ago, opposite the town. We
            are here to have the sailors’ bread baked – some people will not stop here – it is a
            dirty, uninteresting town – but the captains all prefer it to Balliana or Akmim, where
            are most interesting things to do. But our Reis lives here – and we have not the hard
            heart that can insist upon his stopping elsewhere, Theodore and Nettie have been twice
            over to the town to walk – but I have stayed at home – for a cold wind has been blowing
            from the north – a fine sailing wind – and even the deck enclosed <pb n="21"/> with canvas was cold.
            All our fowls – the whole barnyard has been turned out on the sand – chickens – doves –
            geese – turkeys – ducks – rabbits and 3 little brown woolly sheep, that were bought
            today – and a big washing has been going on – and our fluttering clothes make a great
            show on their lines. Everybody very nearly deserted the boat today – and it was very
            quiet. My nice Mohammed who always went everywhere with me last year, and who is a
            brother in law of our Reis – heard on reaching here last night that his father died ten
            days ago – and there has been a great sorrow amongst them. We are interested in our
            daily readings in Kidds Social Evolution. For the first time a few nights ago, we saw
            the Zodiacal light – and since then it has been seen several times – we were a little
            nebulous about the affair – and got out our Astronomy – and read about the little that
            is known of it. </p>

            <p>We left Girgeh about 12 o’clock – having taken on a
            great stock of bread – enough to last until we reach Girgeh again, the Reis says – made
            Balliana about 7 o’clock – and the wind having been very light all day – two dahabeahs –
            the “Mimi” English – and the “Columbia” with the American flag. The former is a new
            private dahabeah, belonging to an Englishman, very attractive in appearance – and what
            arouses my interest in her is that she has a stove pipe! And I wonder whether they have
            a stove arranged or an open fire. This boat, and the very pretty new one belonging to a
            Pole, which lay next us at Cairo – have aroused Theodore’s ardor about building one. He
            always talks of building one <pb n="22"/> going up the Nile – but coming down, there is very little
            said about it. This afternoon just as we had landed the men for tracking, I saw them
            looking at something in the water floating by us, and Nettie and I took up our glasses
            to see what it was – and to our horror discovered it was the body of a woman. It was a
            dreadfully gruesome spectacle! </p>

            floor – in a little while he brings me a fragrant cup of tea – then the hot water comes
            along- then the outside shutters are opened – the sun pours in – and I am ready to get
            up! I intended to have done a great deal of writing <pb n="23"/> today – but it was so charming on
            deck, I could not come below – such fragrant air, full of the perfume of the blossoming
            crops – such lights, such shadows on the utterly desert mountains – such splendid palms
            and groves of scent trees – lubbeks – tamarasks – the song of the shadoof is abroad in
            the land – and today we have passed several musically creaking sakkiehs. At one time
            very near us on a low sand bank, were 10 large pelicans – the biggest I had ever seen –
            they waited until we were quite up to them, then spread their wings, and sailed away on
            the water. Fortunately Theodore and Jones were both below, or the gun would have been
            out. The Mimi has been ahead of us all day – but this afternoon we came up to her
            hopelessly stuck upon a sand bank – and there we left her. But she can much outsail us.</p>

            <p>Started out this morning at 7:30 with a good wind – which held until
            about 11 – when it failed so much that as we drew near Keneh, we debated whether or not
            we would go ashore and find our antiquity dealer of whom Theodore bought two or three
            very good things last year. But we decided not to stop – and the wind increasing we made
            the turn below Keneh in fine style, the river her turning quite sharply to the South
            once more. We careered along in a beautiful manner – the wind so high as to make the
            sailing exciting – and almost dangerous. I stayed below. We passed Coptos – then Kus –
            and about 5 Nagada – and are now about 6 miles from Luxor. </p>

            <p>We could not make our paltry 6 miles to Luxor until about 6 o'clock this evening - though we were 
            trying all day to do it. We pulled up to the gezirah opposite the town - and began settling ourselves 
            in very nearly our old quarters. It was lovely this hot calm day - the mountains opposite Luxor taking 
            such soft pink and heliotrope tints.</p>

            <p><title>Thursday. Jan. 31. </title></p>
            <p>A very quiet and uneventful week at Luxor. I tried to ride over to Karnak the first afternoon –
            and spent the morning of the 2d day in Luxor, principally at Mohammed Mohasib’s – and in
            the afternoon went over to the races – and between them all, grew so tired and added so
            much to my cold – that I have stayed on the boat every day since – except Sunday – when
            Nettie and I went over to the little English chapel for service. We found 4 dahabeahs at
            Luxor – and they were arriving from down the river during the week. I believe we left 11
            lying there. Two days before we came away, we pulled across the river to below the
            German’s new castle. There has been no wind for days – we intended getting away
            yesterday – but there was not a breath – so when after breakfast this morning a fair
            little wind sprang up, Theodore gave orders to start, but it soon failed – and we had to
            take to tracking. We had all our awnings up – and it was entirely charming on deck – so
            quiet – the whole earth wrapped in a white soft shroud of intense heat. We have had
            quite an unpleasant and very exciting experience this after-<pb n="25"/>noon. The men were tracking
            and we were slowly slipping past a high bank near the village of ed-Debayeh about 2
            miles from Erment. Theodore was absorbed in a chess puzzle in the saloon – and I had got
            into my wrapper and was preparing for a good rest – when I heard loud voices and talking
            above – and so much stir that Theodore called up to Nettie who is always on deck to know
            what the trouble was – but he did not wait for an answer but seized a stout stick,
            called out to me as he passed my room that there was trouble on shore, and he was going
            to see what it was. Then Nettie called to me to come quickly – and I hustled into my
            dress and rushed up on deck, just in time to see Jones disappearing over the high bank
            with his gun, and two of our sailors armed with poles, assisting our old Abbocatto over
            the bank in a most unceremonious fashion. The bank was too high and steep for Nettie and
            me to climb, even with assistance – besides there was no one left on the boat but the 2
            cooks – nor could we see over the bank – but we heard a tremendous hubbub, shrieking and
            shouting and two report of the gun – and then I feared serious trouble. Then arrived my
            Mahommed and Ali, with a man in custody, whom they were kicking and beating furiously,
            and whom they flung over the bank – he came headlong – and Ali slid down after him and
            resumed his infuriated beating of him – my calling and cries were not heeded, and as
            Hasan appeared at the top with another man, whom he knocked over the bank and plunged
            after, beating him unmercifully, I flew down the companionway to Selim, the cook, and
            told him to tell Hassan and Ali, that I would not suffer such conduct – that if the men
            were guilty the sheik of the village would <pb n="26"/> punish them, but they should not beat them.
            Then the men were brought on board as prisoners, and I told Selim to protect them from
            violence until we knew what the trouble was. A moment after the uproar grew nearer, and
            swarming over the bank came our people, followed by a crowd of women and children, but
            no men. These women began shrieking more wildly than ever when they saw our two
            prisoners – they threw dust over their heads, and danced about like wild savages. Order
            was given to cast off at once, and a favorable breeze having sprung up, we were able to
            get out of that troublesome neighborhood. They all followed along the bank, making all
            the noise they could and they must have sent some of their people on two mile to a
            landing near Erment, as when we drew up there, we found two gens d’armes waiting for us.
            In the meantime when our men came back to the boat, it was found that the Captain had a
            cruel cut on his head, which was bleeding profusely, and Moussa looked as if he had been
            nearly slaughtered – he head cut open in two places, looking very bad. Ibraim also had a
            bad cut on his arm. They were all in a perfect rage – and it was all that Nettie and I
            and Jones could do, to keep them quiet enough to wash and dress their wound. When we had
            landed and the officers had come on board we had a solemn hearing, except when the
            excitement of the old Reis broke out. A huge audience on the bank – the broken heads
            were exhibited, and a man came on the lower deck from the crowd, to show a broken head
            of his own. Our dignified Selim was summoned from his kitchen, and acted as interpreter
            and then Theodore called for our second captain – our favorite Reis Fuli to give his
            account – which he did in so calm, and <pb n="27"/> perfect a manner, that it was a sight to see, in
            that crowd of angry savages. Reis Mohammed wanted to go back to Luxor, as the officers
            suggested, to enter his complain – but Theodore announced very decidedly that he had
            already had trouble and detention enough – and that he would wait no longer. I must say
            the manner of the officers was excellent – until they took possession of the prisoners –
            whom they hustled about in a very undignified way, but not severe – their turbans being
            torn from their heads, and unwound and used as fetters. One of them was quite an old man
            with a long wound or gash in his leg. I felt tempted to tell Jones to go and dress it –
            but I’m afraid our crew would almost have mobbed him – that being an act of grace to an
            enemy, far from their comprehension. Finally we got away, and let it all behind us – and
            then we began to hear the different incidents of the affair = the only one being that
            Theodore told of our old, and almost decrepid Abbecatto – a painfully timid man, in all
            his daily manifestations, who had hurried to the scene of conflict with the hatchet in
            his hand – which Theodore saw him using (the hammer side) on the back of one of the
            prisoners, as he was being led to the boat by our men. Theodore unceremoniously took the
            hatchet from him, and ordered him back to the boat, feeling that if the old man stopped
            and thought, he might use the other end of it. Theodore says that when he reached the
            village, the Reis and Moussa were standing bleeding but surrounded by the sellers, and
            at some distance from them, the village people were facing them. Moussa had gone to help
            the Reis, <pb n="28"/> who had been worsted in a struggle with some of them – Jones and his gun,
            which he fired occasionally into the air, held the village people at bay, or no doubt
            our men would have fared badly. Everyone was so excited at first, and so concerned to
            see our men wounded, that they could not take a dispassionate view of it – and both
            Theodore and Nettie thought me severe, when I said from the first that I thought we were
            to blame. Our coleric old Reis, instead of entering a complaint with the Sheik of the
            village, got into a temper with some of the people – and no one knows who struck the
            first blow, the mischievous children and boys who threw the mud, of course fell as it so
            often does in this world, on the innocent. The two prisoner, maltreated as they were,
            were not offenders so far as we could learn. It was very comical to reflect, that every
            able bodied man, headed by the Reis, made off to the Reis, made off to the fray, leaving
            the beat, and we two unprotected women to the care of the 2 cooks! It hardly answers to
            our idea of discipline on a ship! We came to Erment and will stay all night – making 9
            miles. </p>

            <p>We have had a very good day – making 40 miles – passed Esneh
            about 5 o’clock. The Columbia which has been quite in advance of us from Luxor, landed
            at Esneh, and the Mansourah, which passed us yesterday during the fracas, still holds
            her own, ahead of us. We met her people in the garden at Erment, where everybody goes to
            buy fruit and vegetables. We are lying 2 or 3 miles from El Kab this evening. </p>

            El Kab – Edfou – Silsilis just at sunset – so that we were able to see the grottos as we
            sailed by – such an interesting point of the river – the rocks coming down to the
            narrowed river – the either side. We have been steadily gaining on the Mansourah all day
            – until the race became very exciting as we draw near Kom Ombo – by a clever move, our
            old Reis cleverly took advantage of a manouvre on their part, and passed them, and soon
            we lost sight of them in the night. The moon is now radiant. We have passed Kom Ombo,

            <p>We dragged through the whole
            day, arriving at Assouan when it was almost too dark to see that beautiful approach, a
            number of dahabeahs here – we are a little in advance of our former position at
            Elephantine. The Isis is just opposite – and Theodore and Nettie have gone over to her,
            to see if her people are going up in their steamer to Wady Halfa, as they expected to do
            tomorrow, when we saw them last. Such a radiant night. </p>

            <p><title>Sunday – Septuagesima. Feb. 10th. </title></p>
            <p>We have had a very hot, unsatisfactory week. The thermometer has ranged from 80-86 in
            the shade. At one time the dahabeahs numbered 12 – of which I am glad to say we were
            always first or second – but <pb n="30"/> the little sand beach along the island of Elephantine is
            very small – and grew to be very smelly. Now that so many dahabeahs go up the river this
            landing place should be under police supervision. There were so many steamers too, on
            the Asouan side, and the river is so narrow here, that they seem very intrusive – and
            the new Cook boats are so big and noisy – with their brilliant electric lights – they
            are a positive offence – and the cataract boats are now so many – and their crews so
            noisy – there was no peace – they were rowing up and down, until 12 o’clock at night –
            singing, and hip-hip hurrahing – with their “tink you tink yous” and “very good, very
            goods”. I grew pretty tired of them – I went once out to Philae – having an extra train
            all to myself – costing but $10. Jones, Mohammed and Ibraim, and the lunch went with me,
            and Theodore and Nettie went over early on donkeys. It was almost one o’clock before I
            got there – I found it crowded with tourists. Pharaoh’s Bed was filled with tables and
            all the Cookites lunching at them. So we had ours far off in one of the colonnades –
            almost exactly in the pot from which Mr. Newman’s picture that Theodore has was painted.
            As we were making our way over there, I saw little Yema coming and I said to Theodore,
            “don’t ay anything, I want to see if he knows me”. He looked at me a moment, and then
            threw out both hands with an exclamation that was quite tragic, and with a cry of joy
            rushed forward to see me. Very little grown – the same sweet, appealing little fellow –
            he stuck closely by me all the time. Then we asked for “Dendowi” and he was shortly
            produced – looking more like a small, brown reproduction of Queen Victoria than ever –
            and with the same impertur-<pb n="31"/>bable dignity – Philae seemed more lovely to me and
            interesting than ever – I suppose because its doom seems to have been pronounced. We
            could see on the walls of Pharaoh’s Bed – coloured wafers at a certain level – showing
            where the inundation water would reach, if the dam is built. I did not see the Newman –
            as I did not feel equal to climbing down to their dahabeah – and I wanted so much to
            talk to her about Yemma – Theodore saw them for a few moments in the temple – but with
            many people about them – Yemma told me Mrs. Newman had given him everything he had on –
            and proceeded to show me each article – first beginning with his turban, which we had
            already remarked, as being very large and impressive. This he took off his head and
            unwound, showing a pair of drawers, which he put on, after discreetly turning his back.
            We came home in one of the Cataract boats – the crew particularly picturesque with their
            turbans and flashing white teeth. The descent of the cataract too, seemed more exciting
            than ever. We passed the little island, against whose black rocks we came to grief, when
            we tried to get up the cataract last year with the Herodotus. And we have felt much
            aggrieved to see a dahabeah coming in after her descent – and to see the pretty little
            Polish boat pass us one morning, with banners flying and guns firing, on her way to the
            ascent. I have been once over to the town and the bazaar – and for a short sail one
            evening before dinner – all the rest of the time I have stayed on the boat – not daring
            to venture out in the heat of the day – or in the cool of the evening. I always think
            one of the pleasantest things to do at <pb n="32"/> Assouan is to walk on the island of Elephantine –
            but I could not do this because of the heat. It is so densely clothed with palms and
            other trees that in this heat it harboured millions of mosquitos, which were quite
            annoying. The night with the full moon have been quite beautiful – and all of the time
            we have the music of the same old croaking sakkish in our ears. The Scott-Elliots are
            expected down from Wady Half tomorrow – but we shall not wait for them, but start early
            for Kom Ombos – quite glad to get away from Assouan. </p>

            <p>Jones went over quite early this morning for the last mail, and then we made ready to start – all the
            fowls were caught and cooped – stakes brought in – ropes slipped. The Zunt-el-Nil came
            up yesterday close behind us, ready to slip into our place when we left, and we saw our
            old Reis Achmed of the Nubia, who is now Captain of the Zunt-el-Nil so nice and
            dignified – we dropped down the river, stopped here and there to put off some friends of
            the Captains or one of the crew. </p>

            <p>In my haste the evening of the 12th at Kom Ombo I forgot the day before – when we made 18 miles only. We made our 8
            miles to Kom Ombo by half past 3 o’clock, almost to our surprise we found ourselves at
            Kom Ombo and the Columbia lying there. We waited until 5 o’clock, until the heat had
            abated a little, and then went up. I had never seen this temple before, except in
            passing. Two years ago, it was cleaned <pb n="33"/> and excavated by Mr. de Morgan – too much
            cleaned, many people think. It is certainly very swept and garnished and is most
            comfortable to get about in for that reason – and no clamorous natives about. It is so
            imposing up on its height, and has some characteristic features. The evening light was
            delicious – and the views from that height – Theodore and Nettie went up again this
            evening to see the moonlight effects. The Columbia has gone and 2 Cook steamers are here
            – but everything is very quiet, and the peace and pure air delicious after the noise and
            smells of Assouan. </p>

            the most impressive sights of the Nile. This morning, directly after breakfast we went
            up to the temple again, I took my camera, and made some views. The Isis came up last

            that we dropped down easily to Edfou – starting at 8:30 this morning, and reaching Edfou
            at 4 o’clock, making 26 miles. We waited awhile, as <pb n="34"/> it was too much to go out into the

            opposite side of the river, because of the wind – it has been banging and knocking us
            about in the most pronounced manner I have ever known on the river. The Isis was close
            behind us – and most of her people, as well at Theodore and Nettie, crossed in the
            felucca to the little new house at the El Kab landing, which we had noticed on our way
            up, and which we were sure was occupied by Mr. Tylor, or Mr. Somers-Clarke. They found
            the latter there, busy with his excavations – and wearing the native dress. We will go
            over tomorrow early, and make him a visit, and see the temple that he discovered, and is
            now excavating. The north wind still raging – but much cooler. </p>

            <p>We pulled across the river early this morning and directly after breakfast went up to see
            Mr. Somers-Clarke, whom we found with his workmen, busy at his excavations. He is
            beginning to lay bare the remains of a temple within the great inclosing walls of the
            ancient fortress. Thee walls are built of mud bricks, and are of extraordinary
            thickness, - 37 ft. wide, and of course are very ruinous – as the ancient city is
            supposed to have existed under the Old Empire. Mr. Somers-Clarke discovered the site of
            the temple, which was not known, and has made several trenches, which reveal certain
            limits, and the two entrance portals – and the lines of walls. It would seem to be in a
            great mix – that is newer buildings had been placed on the site of older ones – and the
            old materials used for the new. Thus cartouches of Thotmes II and III – with the good
            bas relief work and painting of that period, are found with the much poorer work of much
            more recent periods. Fragments of columns – and bases of painting and carved columns
            were seen – and ruined and mutilated statues. The infiltration of Nile water, with its
            decomposing salts has made the stones almost into powder, and the work has to be very
            carefully and slowly done. He had 12 workmen. He afterwards took us to his house, where
            he showed us the plans of the temple so far as he had been able to trace them. It was
            most interesting. He had had a mud house built in which he lives, and indeed it is still
            building – that is quite a large vaulted room, which is to serve as dining and living
            room is being completed. He has one room for himself, another for his colleague, and a
            little court with <pb n="36"/> kitchen and room for his 2 men. His own room had merely plastered
            walls, and a sand floor spread upon a base of finely broken potsherds which form an
            excellent drainage – and as he wear the native dress, with no stockings, and the big red
            native shoes, which he kicks off as soon as he enters his house, and the sand is
            pleasant enough – then when he wants a new carpet as he said, the sand is all swept out,
            and fresh sand is brought in. His bed, working table, shelves for books etc. were rather
            primitive, but he said he found it comfortable. It was quite a revelation to see him in
            the native dress – he used always to be so fastidiously dressed in white flannels and
            gaiters. He always wears glasses, which now look so incongruous. He wears the complete
            dress – tarboosh, turban, white vest and blue cotton dress. He finds it most comfortable
            he says – and the only tolerable thing for his work, that it all goes into the wash tub
            every day. The dust that excavating makes would be greatly trying to an European dress.
            We were greatly entertained with him, his work and manner of living. He walked down to
            the dahabeah with us and sat awhile. All the men were amazed to see him. We got off by
            11 o’clock, and reached Esneh just at dark – making the 17-1/2 miles – though there was
            almost no wind. The Isis preceeded us, making a very early start from El Kab, and
            getting the benefit of the good south wind that blew during the early morning. Dr. Ware
            came over this evening – they will have their bread early, and will start for Luxor at 6
            o’clock in the morning, while we must wait all day tomorrow here for our baking. </p>

            <p>It has been excessively hot all day – and I have not
            been off the boat – not feeling well. Theodore and Nettie walked to the Temple this
            morning, and this afternoon had some donkeys and rode into the country – falling with
            some boys whom we met here before – and went with Alexander to his house for some coffee
            – which visit they found quite interesting. The house large, and modern – and well
            furnished. All the principal people in Esneh are Copts. The men of the family all came
            in to talk to them – and were immensely dignified, well dressed men – all having just
            been to church. The Egyptian part of Esneh is indescribably dirty and horrid, like a
            great gray wasp’s nest – and not half as clean. </p>

            <p>Our bread was very late arriving this morning, and as a fine south wind was blowing, we grew very impatient
            to get off, which we did not do until half past nine. We had both sails up, and made
            such splendid progress, that we stayed on deck all the time in spite of the heat. The
            thermometer at the hottest part of the day, was at 86°. We were amazed to see the
            chimneys of Erment, and at 3:30 we were tied to the bank above the Castle – the Isis
            being just around the corner on the other side. We are lying at a very pretty bank –
            full of the blossoming hummis, a kind of pea – with trees at the top – and a lovely view
            of the broad river with the yellow desert and the mountains of the <pb n="38"/> Tombs of the Kings –
            and all that great ancient Necropolis. The Ammon Ra, Cooks dahabeah, with the English
            people with the daughter ill with typhoid fever, which we left here, is now moored on
            the opposite side of the river, with quarantine flags on either side of her. She has now
            2 cases of it, and below her is a French dahabeah, also in quarantine with a case of
            typhoid. We congratulated ourselves that we lie so far above them. Theodore was talking
            to Dr. Ware this evening about them. We were having tea on deck when Miss Wallace who
            had been taking a row, came to see us – looking so much better. </p>

            <p>So hot today I only went for a little walk on the top of the bank – but very glad to reach home
            again. Miss Wallace and Mr. and Mrs. Scott-Elliot came to dine with us this evening – we

            <p>I had a most delightful donkey ride this morning with Theodore out
            to Karnac, where we did not stop, and along a high embankment near the desert, and a
            long route home through the delicious green, green fields, the barley just in head.
            Never was air so pure and fragrant. The wide valley here at Luxor is highly cultivated,
            and almost park like in effect. It was a great treat to me – and the first real donkey
            ride I have had. Theodore met the Uncle of the typhoid English young lady this morning.
            He was seated near Theodore at table when we were at <pb n="39"/> Cairo, and Theodore found him very
            nice. He says that the 3 cases of fever are supposed to have been caught on the
            Messageries steamer, on which they all came over. But as they subsequently all stayed at
            the Continental in Cairo, it is not easy to attach suspicion to the right quarter. </p>

            <p>At home all the morning. At 2:30 we crossed in the felucca to the
            other side for a visit to Der el Bahari, which I have not seen since the great
            excavations of the past two years. It was a rather hot ride and hard one for me. We
            found the Isis people already on the spot - photographing and sketching – of all the
            interesting places at this point of the river –this most appeals to the imagination. The
            unique position – the baldness of the conception of a mortuary chapel (for it is now
            considered to be one, rather than a temple, just as the so called temple of Goornah –
            the Ramesseum – and Medinet Habou, are mortuary temples of the kings who built them). M.
            Naville under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Fun, has accomplished marvelous
            things – and still has an army of work people digging at the lower terraces, and at the
            accumulated rubbish of centuries that lies beneath the temple. A long colonnade resting
            against the cliff has been laid bare – and the northern and southern colonnades at right
            angles to this, with accompanying chapels and rooms, with brilliant paintings and
            carvings – though these do not compare with the fineness and beauty of the decorations
            of the terrace above built by Queen Hat-<pb n="40"/>shepshu – with it beautiful realistic carvings
            which tell so plainly the story of the expedition to the land of Punt. M. Naville
            himself, who has built himself a house near came and kindly told us much of it. A large
            portion of the encumbering and defacing Coptic remains have been taken away, and some
            stone forming a part of the Story of Punt have been found in the mass of debris, and
            restored to their places. The colonnaded ruins now form a picturesque sight resting
            against the bold yellow cliffs. Before long the terraces and approaches will all be laid
            bare, and the ruin will form a spectacle to delight and interest the world. It was quite
            dark as we came home in the felucca – only a line of crimson yellow in the western sky,
            reflected in the water, and above it brilliant and soft, Venus, casting a line of
            rippling silver across the water. </p>

            <p><title>Saturday. Feb. 23d. </title></p>
            <p>Home all day yesterday – quite used up with my expedition of yesterday. The Misses Scott-Elliot came to breakfast with
            Dr. Ware – and after Nettie went for the whole day at Karnac – Theodore and I took Dr.
            Ware for an inspection of that certain crossing of the island to the Tombs of the Kings,
            and afterwards met Miss and Mr. Scott-Elliot and her brother and visited the Luxor
            temple – there are now no workman there – all excavation having been stopped until the
            mosque and another part of the town can be bought and taken down. It is tantalizing to
            see a beautiful colossal face looking out from the accumulation of ages, under one of
            the houses. Afterwards I went into the Luxor hotel grounds, and <pb n="41"/> came across Theodore,
            Dr. Ware and Mr. Scott-Elliot all partaking of lemonade in the big bar room, and I was
            at once asked to join them, which I did, finding the lemonade uncommonly nasty, and
            reminding me of that we used to have in our childish feasts, the delight of which was
            that we made it ourselves. After tea in the afternoon, Theodore and I went for a ride
            over the richly cultivated plains back of Luxor. I had a new donkey – having declined my
            hard little beast I have been riding and he proved delightful – his name was I was told
            at first California, shortly it changed to Ohio, and at last proved to be Gazelle. Such
            an entrancing ride along the high banks raised like huge interesting walls about the
            country – bordering the deep canals most of them now quite dry – mile upon miles of
            barley and wheat field just coming into full head – and in the light of the declining
            sun, forming a light green shimmering sheen on every side – interested by villages under
            their pale and scent trees – the blue smoke of their evening fires in a level line above
            them – flocks and herds in the fields – laborers going home from their work – and the
            air fresh and fragrant after the hot day. In some places where we went along the little
            paths through the fields, the barley was higher than my donkey – and as we came home
            along the river bank, the crimson yellow inset line and the brilliant Venus – and all
            reflected in the darkening river. I am quite sure I should tire very much of living in
            such an unchanging climate. Nothing but the exigencies of ill health could make me
            contented with an unfailing cloudless sky – unreasonable as it sounds. Yet we can be
            truly thankful this winter for it, when all the civilized <pb n="42"/> world of Europe and America is
            fast bound in ice and cold. The severity of the storm we read of in our paper and
            letters is quite appalling – while one thermometer during the day on deck in the shade
            ranges from 80 to 88 – though the night are cold – night before last after a very hot
            day, it was 45 at 7 o’clock in the morning. The radiation is so very rapid under this
            absolutely cloudless sky. </p>

            in the afternoon to Der el Bahari – I did not feel up to either of these excursions –
            but went down to Karnac at 4 o’clock in the felucca, with one, where our donkeys had
            been sent, and spent an hour and a half there, riding home around the town the long way

            <p>I rode into the town this morning, while
            Theodore, Nettie and Dr. Ware walked to Mohammed Mohassibs – where we spent an hour or
            two talking to the old man and looking at his things. Theodore bought two or three
            pretty things – Mohassib presented us all with parting souvenirs – and we said a
            prolonged and quite an affectionate goodbye. Before we started on our walk this morning
            we had the two little arab sisters, who when we were in Luxor on our way up, moored at
            the gezireh on the other side of the river, used to come every day with their father,
            who <pb n="43"/> looked after our fowls and sheep. They were such pretty children, with the most
            impossible garments in rags hanging about them – the older one with a bad cough. I used
            to watch the younger one, who was a perfect beauty of roundness and grace, as she played
            with the wind and in the water, with the grace and natural abandonment of a young animal
            – and I told Selim to tell the father to go over to Luxor and buy each of them a dress
            and a pair of drawer, and I would pay for them. So the day after they came immensely
            proud and grateful to show their new clothes – a dark blue cotton dress, with an
            undergarment, and a thin beflowered blue cloth veil – in all of which they were not half
            so picturesque but much more comfortable. After we had been in Luxor this time four or
            five days, they discovered us, and appeared – their new clothes very much toned down by
            dirt and use. I gave the older child a flannel under shirt of mine, that was so shrunken
            I could not wear it, and she immediately retired into the depths of the wheat field at
            the top of the bank, and put it on, in all this unbearable heat – and although she never
            had worn anything so thick and warm, she persisted in keeping it on. We had them on deck
            – to their great delight – and gave them some oranges and sweets to carry away with them
            – the older girl was remarkably pretty – with perfect teeth, and the sweetest smile and
            her delight in everything she saw, was touching. She patted the rugs on which she sat,
            gazing about and saying softly to herself quies-quies (pretty). Then we made them stand
            in the sun and photographed them - and we had my Mohammed and Hassan move the big hooded
            chair into the sun, and she sat by me in it, and Nettie photographed us – altogether <pb n="44"/>
            they had a beautiful spree – and when we came back from town, and word was given to
            start, and they saw preparations made, they came on deck to say goodbye, the older girl
            could not restrain her tears – and I felt quite broken myself, and almost wanted to
            carry her away with me – she was not more than 8. We got away at 1 o’clock, very glad to
            be moving in all that heat – the Isis came on directly behind us – the afternoon was
            calm, or with a flutter of South wind – and we easily made 24 miles before pulling up
            for the night. </p>

            Theodore and Nettie rode into the town on a vain quest for interesting antiquities –
            while Jones and Selim went for provisions. Then we pulled over to Denderah where the
            Isis was, and everybody went except myself to see the temple. The heat was too great for
            me – and I never find that temple very interesting. We went off, leaving the Isis, at 6

            Karshout, and are now lying about 4 miles below Farshout – the Isis behind us. Very hot
            all day – it has been impossible to do anything. Thermometer in shade on deck has been
            up to 94 – the night very warm and still – the little new moon, and Venus per-<pb n="45"/>fectly 
            reflected in the glassy water. We find the only way to keep tolerably comfortable is to
            close the windows in the morning early, as soon as the servants have finished cleaning,
            shutters, blinds and all – and possibly the canvass over them – and I am pleased to find

            attempt Abydos. The Isis people are waiting until tomorrow too, for the expedition. But
            we are feeling a little doubtful tonight about it – as the heat has been extreme – 99 on
            deck this afternoon, under the awning – Theodore and Nettie walked down to the Isis –
            but I preferred the clean quiet deck – at 6 o’clock the thermometer was still at 80 –
            and Theodore has wisely announced that unless a cool north wind blows in the morning, he
            will start down. I shall be sorry not to see that beautiful Temple – and to miss that

            <p>The morning dawned hot and still – and Abydos was impossible. So we started at

            sand bank opposite the town, and went for a little walk. Made today 20 miles. Ramadan
            began a few days ago –and the first day was strictly kept by both our Captains, and one
            or two of our crew. Old Salim, the cook, of course keeps it, being a Mohammedan of the
            strictest sect. Our coleric old Rais Mohammed, with his childish nature, was the picture
            of woe during the day – and unusually irascible with the sailors – and gradually as the
            day wore on, he accumulated at a little corner at the head of the gang way where he
            always stands or sits, two dishes with covers, containing food – a batch of some kind of
            a pickle of which they are enormously fond, a pile of dried dates, and his cigarette
            case – he hovered over these from time to time, and finally sat flat down upon the deck,
            tumbled his tobacco into his lap, and began making cigarettes. He was such a funny
            picture of the commanding officer of a vessel, with his bare feet sticking out from his
            robe. Finally the sun went down – and they had something to eat, and a smoke, and things
            were more serene. It is really hard on the working people – a day with nothing to eat or
            to smoke from sunset to sunrise. My donkey boy in Luxor was bewailing one day that
            Ramadan began the next day – he said “no eat – no smoke – no cigarettes – no water – no
            everything”. Their habit too of eating enormously after the fast of the day – and
            keeping awake to eat most of the night, upsets them sadly – and makes one wish to try
            and reason with them. Our <pb n="47"/> people, however, are not hurting themselves – and the fast was
            given up after the second day. </p>

            <p>A cool, light north wind was blowing
            this morning. Started at 7 and made Akmim at noon – where we stopped, and sent into town
            on a vain search for the antiquity dealer of last year – he was not to be found however.
            We tried rowing for awhile but the north wind was too strong – and sunset found us
            anchored in the stream just below the town – then the wind falling a little, our Rais
            ventured again, but we got into a very difficult place – and finally put up the sail and
            sailed up the river for half a mile, and anchored to a sand bank. </p>

            in the bazaar – nothing seemed nice in Assiout today – but the smell of orange blossoms
            as we passed the big garden – and we were glad to be back on the boat again. We are at

            found the bank at which we lay last night, very muddy – the Nile having lately left it –
            and the rank smell that came from it most disagreeable, and I am sure unhealthy. We have
            a lovely air tonight, the north wind which has been blowing a gale all day, and
            prevented our moving, has moderated, and is very sweet, soft and fresh. All the Isis

            <p>A north wind all day – but we have
            managed to make 25 miles – passing the big Aboufoydah chain. We overtook the Isis early
            in the day – and were also in company with the London, a dahabeah whose people <pb n="49"/> had left
            her at Girgeh – and she was making her way down to Cairo – closed and shrouded in her
            canvass coverings. Late this afternoon as we sat on deck, she being very close to us, we
            heard shouts proceeding from a working boat that was coming up the river – and some
            excited talk between the two crews – on the working boat was a dragoman, with servant,
            who (as we learned) called out to the Rais of the London, that he was wanted by a
            gentleman to go to Assouan, that he would arrive by train tomorrow, and that he (the
            Dragoman) had orders to engage her for two months. They at once put up their oars – and
            unfurled their sails – and made for the shore, where the Dragoman was landing. It was
            such a sudden and unexpected change for the men – and they were so delighted with
            another engagement of 2 months – for at this time of the year they are generally falling
            out of work. There were many congratulations called out to them from our boat. This
            morning as the Postal Steamer Hatasou passed us quite close, we saw Mr. Lapsley who was
            waving to us, and staring at us through his glasses. We are within two or three miles of
            Haji Kandeel – the station for Tel el-Amarna – which we intend visiting tomorrow. </p>

            <p>A heavy north wind blowing all the morning. In the afternoon floating
            and rowing we reached Haji Kandeel about 4 o’clock. A very noisy unpromising crowd of
            natives gathered on the shore – and such a vociferation went on, I was forced to come
            below, to get away from them. Theodore and Nettie walked about on shore. The Isis having
            come <pb n="50"/> up with us this evening, Dr. Ware came over, and we all had a game of domino whist.

            <p>The day dawned very gray and cold – high wind – having taken cold a day or two ago, I wisely
            decided to stay in the boat. A still more noisy, rude and vociferous crowd, with their
            donkeys about the boat, and the choice of the latter was not difficult, when all were so
            poor and jaded. They came back about 11 o’clock having seen part of the grottoes or tomb
            – and very tired of their poor donkeys. The guides did not know anything about the
            grottoes – and instead of going to the North, which are the best, and seeing the tomb of
            Amenophis IV or Khuenaten, they had only gone to the south – and missed the rest.
            Nettie’s donkey fell with her, and gave her quite a shock. We came away from that noisy
            shore at once, but the north wind was so strong, that after struggling against it for
            half an hour, we took refuge at the end of a sand bank, opposite and a little way blow,
            the Isis, and anchored strongly – the water rushing in real waves past us – and the sand
            flying furiously and her we are for the night I suppose – as, although there is a full
            moon – there is little prospect of the wind dying out. </p>

            miles here by 3 o’clock – and when we got up we found ourselves just behind the Isis –
            who it seems only got in two hours before us, the tug having broken down when they had
            made about 5 miles. They left the boat immediately after breakfast, and went out ot the

            into Cairo this morning on his donkey – to see about our rooms at Shepheards – and to
            get our mail. Nettie and I went over to the Museum –and I saw for the first time the
            wonderfully interesting and beautiful things found within the past few months at
            Dahshour. The <pb n="54"/> exquisite jewelry – the wooden statue, of King Hor, and his sentry box in
            which the statue was enclosed – the sarcophagi – and the extraordinary group of soldiers
            – in 2 groups – of 40 each – the figures about a foot high – and executed in the most
            life like manner – one company of Egyptians, and the other of Soudanese – it is
            extraordinary work for the 12th Dynasty. As we were coming out of the Museum, we saw
            Mary Parsons, whom Theodore had hoped to see at Shepheards. Theodore brought a great
            bunch of letters and papers – and after lunch we all went again over to the Museum. </p>

            <p>Mary Parsons and Miss Crane appeared quite early this morning – and
            were quite interested in going over the dahabeah. When they had gone, we stared out to
            the Pyramids, Theodore and Nettie on their donkeys – and I in the bid landau with
            Mahommed on the box – we were just in time for lunch with the Isis people – and
            afterwards Theodore and Nettie went over to the Pyramids – while I sat on the terrace
            and waited - and was bored, and devoured with flies – and the day was very blustering
            and like a March day at home – so that driving back I had the top of the carriage
            raised, and wrapped myself in my big cloak. Mary Parsons came to dine and pass the
            night, and she is much delighted with our life on board. Our men gave one of their best
            concerts and did some dancing, and we sat on deck, enclosed by the awnings with the
            lanterns lighted, until we were forced to go below by the chill night air. Tomorrow
            begins the unpleasant work of dismantling – settling with the <pb n="55"/> men and leaving the boat –
            which in spite of my great joy and satisfaction in finishing this Nile journey, still
            has an element of sadness in it – for after all, this Herodotus has been our home for 2

            <p>We came across the river and down to Cairo directly after breakfast. Theodore took Mary ashore, and goes to the
            bazaar with her and Miss Crane – and Nettie and I, with Jones, pitched into the business
            of packing – our pretty adornments and personal things were soon hauled down from the
            walls, and when Theodore came back to lunch he found a dismantled boat, and stumbled
            everywhere over trunks and boxes. After lunch, I sat down to write references for such
            of the men that we give them to, that is the Captains, 2 indoor men and cook – and
            Theodore began piling up various little heaps of gold, intended for baksheesh for every
            body. The first Captain, Reis Mohammed got six pounds – our favorite Reis Fuls, 2 –
            Capt. Got 4 pounds – the cook Salim 10 pounds – and each sailor 1 pound. This baksheesh
            business is always an uncertain affair – depending entirely on the generosity of the
            person who hires the dahabeah – and has nothing whatever to do with the regular wages of
            the men. There is always great expectancy on their part, and very often no doubt, great
            disappointment. About 4 o’clock, all these affairs having been wound up, we bade a warm
            farewell to all, and departed for Shepheards – where we are now most comfortably
            installed in the same <pb n="56"/> apartment we had in December. But what an age ago that seems! </p>

            morning at 10 o’clock, we are still tied strongly to the dock, with the wind blowing a
            furious gale, and making it impossible to put to sea. We left Cairo yesterday afternoon
            at 4 o’clock – and spent last night at the Khedivial Hotel. We had six days in Cairo,
            which we used to the best advantage we could. I went over to the Bazaar once – and once
            again to the Museum, where I saw the 9 wonderful statues of one of the Usertesens, found
            at Lisht, and the beautiful statue in basalt of Osiris, found at Medinet Habou. One
            afternoon Theodore and I drove to the Gezireh Hotel which I had not seen, and called on
            the Isis people. It is quite magnificent – there can be no other quite so splendid – as
            it was the favorite palace of the old Ismail Pacha, who was buried the other day in
            Cairo. On this palace he lavished millions – and I can well believe it. The extensive
            grounds are very beautiful and highly cultivated. We walked around to the Casino, and
            had tea on the terrace, where there was a gay throng of every nationality. The air was
            full of the fragrance of orange blossoms. I had one other little drive one afternoon,
            but that was all, as the wind blew violently every day, and the dust was omnipresent.
            Mary Parsons and the three ladies she was travelling with (among them Miss Gifford, aunt
            of Edie Gifford of Milwaukie, and a very sweet attractive woman) were at Shepheards, and
            on their way to Syria. Mary <pb n="57"/> was so unwell, and unfit for uncertain Syrian travel, that
            it was thought best she should join our party and return home with us – which to our
            great pleasure she did. We used to spend hours at the carpet bazaar of Madjar’s next the
            hotel – a most curious, delightful and original little old goose it has ever been my
            pleasure to meet. Theodore bought some lovely things of him, and the bargaining between
            the two, used to be a thing to hear. Much of our time was spent in the effort to arrange
            a method of studying English for our 2 faithful Mahommedan boys, Mahomet and Hassan –
            and an arrangement was finally made with the head of the American Mission School, to
            provide them with a private tutor for one hour each day, a shilling an hour – for, as
            they know nothing of study or application it would be impossible for them to go into a
            school – and we want and they are very anxious to learn to speak English – as it
            improves their chances as sailors, and for everything. Theodore arranged to give them a
            pound a month for their living expenses – and they were to get a little room somewhere
            and live in it. We bought them some new clothes – gave them 2 table sand chairs we had
            had on the dahabeah, a big straw mat for the floor, and a big red thick blanket – towels
            – candles and candle-stick. Yossen our young Arab Copy friend, who is in business in
            Cairo is to have a friendly eye over them – and Mr. Bachelor the Manager of Shepheards
            received the money from Theodore, with exact written directions, and kindly offered to
            give it to the boy on their monthly application – so that we left them in very good
            shape. Dr. Ware came to luncheon on our last day, and all the Isis people to tea the
            afternoon before. Mahomet <pb n="58"/> and Hassan were with us most of the time, and at the station
            we found Abbecatio and old Selim – and the last thing we saw as the train moved off, was
            our 2 poor boys looking bereft and distressed. We are rather pleased with the look of
            this boat – but have always avoided this line, it was a necessity however, as we could
            not get into any other boat sailing about this time. </p>

            <p><title>Hotel, Grand Bretagne. <lb/>
            Florence, April 7th. Palm Sunday. </title></p>
            <p>We have passed many an uncomfortable hour since I last made an
            entry in this journal. We got off from Alexandria the morning after but soon after
            sailing lost one of the sailors overboard, who fortunately was able to swim and get onto
            a buoy – a small boat with 6 men was sent out to him in the heavy sea, and was capsized,
            and had it not been for 2 pilot boats in the neighborhood, who went to their assistance,
            all the 7 could have been lost. It was more than 3 hours before we got them on board,
            during which time we lay at anchor, tossing and rolling. The Singapore proved to be very
            slow, very dirty – badly officered – bad food – and a noisy lot of Germans and Italians
            – and I thought the days and particularly, the nights would never end. On the first of
            April we arrived at Messina, where we stayed 12 hours. We went ashore and drove about
            the rather uninteresting Italian town – the dust and wind being the principal factors.
            The next morning we were at Naples, where the boat was to stay 40 hours – and we
            delightfully made preparations to spend the day and night on shore. We drove to the
            Grand Hotel, which <pb n="59"/> we found overflowing with people – and were obliged to go up to the
            Wet End where we got very pleasant rooms. But the weather was cold, wind high, and a
            thick atmosphere – and Vesuvius quite invisible. I was not well during the night, and
            the next morning when Jone appeared from the Singapore, saying she would not leave until
            sometime in the night, and would take 24 hours to Leghorn, where we had expected to
            leave her, we held solemn council and decided to go directly by rail to Florence. So
            Jones was sent back to the boat to pack and bring away our trunks, and Theodore went off
            to secure a compartment in the night train to Rome, and the Dr. was sent for to see me
            and say if I was fit to start, and the upshot of the whole thing was, that we had a very
            comfortable night on the train arriving in Rome at 6:30am. We drove to the Quirinal
            Hotel o short a distance off, and had a good wash, followed by a delicious breakfast in
            the restaurant, and were off to Florence at 8:30 – reaching there at 2:30. The town is
            very, very full – and we had some difficulty about the number of our rooms – but are not
            quite pleasantly settled. Yesterday morning Theodore, Mary and I went to the Uffizzi –
            Nettie not being well enough to go with us. Dr. Baldwin and Mr. Berenson came to tea
            yesterday in the afternoon – and directly after lunch today Theodore, Mary and I drove
            to Fiesole, and out over the Mts. Theodore went off by himself this morning to the Pitti
            – Mary to church – and I stayed home with Nettie, who though better is still weak – but
            there is now no danger of any fever, as we feared at first there might be. The Quincy
            Shaws of Boston, with Mrs. Louis Agassiz are in this hotel, and Miss Shaw and Mrs.
            Agassiz came to <pb n="60"/> tea yesterday afternoon. We met the Bronsons yesterday driving – and
            Mrs. B. called today. </p>

            <p><title>Wednesday. April 10. </title></p>
            <p>We are all ready to leave this delicious
            Florence tomorrow – though we do it very unwillingly – but our time is short, and
            beautiful and interesting things so crowd upon one here, that choice is difficult. We
            have arranged a little driving tour with Mr. Berenson who will go with us – and will
            start tomorrow for Sienna. The Dr. thinks Nettie can now safely venture. We have had
            some delicious drives and walks – and visits to galleries and churches. Among the things
            I had never before seen were the frescoes by Benozzo Gozzoli in the chapel of the
            Riccardi palace – which I knew and admired greatly from my photographs of them – that
            the dark, irregularly shaped little chapel was a surprising disappointment to me –
            though the frescoes were not. One afternoon Mr. Berenson took us to see the new
            Boticelli which has lately been discovered in the Pitti palace. It seems that an old
            gentleman who knew all about pictures, went one day to call on the Duke of Aosta in his
            apartment at the Pitti and being left to cool his heels sometime in the antechamber,
            noticed high up in a dark corner a picture which he thought in the Botticelli style and
            knowing that a certain painting of his known once to have existed was now lost, he went
            to the director of the Museum and told him what he had seen. The result was that the
            picture was removed to one of the private rooms of the Uffizzi –and the world has found
            a new art treasure – though it was not the picture <pb n="61"/> that had been searched for so long –
            and no one at the present time knew that Botticelli had painted such a picture as this.
            It is a picture of a woman charmingly painted in Botticelli’s best manner, standing by a
            centaur. Mr. Berenson has written a pamphlet on the subject, which I hope soon to see.
            It is not yet exhibited to the public, and we saw it only through Mr. Berenson. We took
            Mrs. Fearing with us – and she went with us to some of the galleries. There are so many
            Americans in Florence at the moment. The Dan Fearings are at the Hotel de la Ville, near
            us. Today Nettie went out in the morning for a drive, and then again in the afternoon to
            San Miniato, and went into the church for a few minutes. This morning I went to
            Palotti’s with Theodore, where we met the Thatcher Adams and Mrs. Bronson. Theodore
            bought some lovely old Venetian brocade, and four charming cushions of green Genoa
            velvet. </p>

            <p><title>Saturday, April 13. </title></p>
            <p>We left Florence on Thursday morning soon after breakfast in
            two landaus – sending Jones with the heavy luggage by train – and stopping two hours
            during the middle of the day for rest and lunch – reached Sienna by 6:30 – the distance
            being 40 miles. It was an enchanting drive – the day was perfect – the roads likewise –
            leading over the hills and down the hills, and along the valleys – the country very
            hilly, with strange abrupt little hills, almost every one crowned with a walled town, or
            a convent, or a fortress. Olive orcharcs and vineyards everywhere, violets and anemones
            and periwinkles blooming along <pb n="62"/>  the banks and roadsides. We went clattering through the
            narrow, tony street of one little town after another – and with our jingling bells and
            creaking whips – and as it was Holy Thursday all the people were out in their best
            attire, and having a holiday. I had never posted through Italy before – and we were
            enchanted with the mode of travel – and I was not one bit tired on reaching Sienna –
            which is very effective on the crest of its 3 hills as it were, with its campaniles and
            tower, and great encircling wall. Our hotel, the Grand Hotel Royal de Seinne, was an old
            palace and stands high above the valley with beautiful views, and our lofty rooms open
            on to a stone parapet overlooking the neighborhood to the wet – Nettie is again not well
            – and I have been staying at home with her all day – she got too tired I fear the other
            day on her drive here. Yesterday we sallied out early under Berenson’s leadership, and
            walked about the town, visiting the Palazzo Publico, the great town hall, built in the
            latter part of the 11th century. Close to it rises the slender campanile called Del
            Mangia – it stands in the square now called Vittorio Emanuele, and used to be the Piazza
            del Campo – it is strangely semicircular in form, and rising like an amphitheatre.
            Dante, in his Purgatorio speaks of this piazza. The interior is very interesting – with
            frescoes of the Siennese masters – a large one of the Virgin and child, with a canopy
            borne by saints, and opposite an equestrian portrait of a martial figure of Fogliani de
            Ricci – by Simone Martini. In the Sala dei Nova, are frescoes by Ambrogio Lorenzetti
            painted in 1337-39 – much <pb n="63"/> injured by dampness, but most quaint and interesting. Then we
            went to the Duomo, which was begun in the early part of the 13th century. It is built in
            courses of white and black marble, which at first give a very bizarre effect – but the
            infinite variety of detail, and the richness of the marbles make the interior very
            interesting. The pavement too is remarkably rich in graffiti – though much of it is
            covered with boards and cannot be seen. </p>

            <p><title>Easter, April 14. </title></p>
            <p>We spent most of the morning
            at the Duomo, listening to a high mass – music not very good, but the whole scene was
            impressive. When we all became quite frozen we came away. It has been raining a little
            all day – and I have been indoors all the afternoon. At sunset last evening, Theodore,
            Mary and I walked to the fortress as it is called, or the “Lizza” a beautiful promenade
            with fine trees and shrubberies up the side of a former fortress built by Charles V, -
            giving charming views from its height over plain and mountains. </p>

            <p><title>Easter Monday, April 15. </title></p>
            <p>The rain of yesterday has given place to a cloudy cold day – and putting on our warmest
            wraps we went after breakfast to the Baptistry of the Duomo, which I called S. Giovanni,
            and forms a kind of crypt – though the front is open to the small piazza of S. Giovanni.
            There is here the most wonderful marble font, with splendid bronze reliefs by Ghiberti
            and J. della Quercia, and Donatello. There are <pb n="64"/> 2 especially beautiful bronzes by
            Donatello at the corners of the reliefs – figures of Hope and Faith – the lines so grand
            – the pose so dignified and natural – and 3 delicious little bronze cherubs, quite
            perfect – the beautiful marble work is by della Quercia. Then we went to the Opera del
            Duomo, over the way and saw many wondrous things. Quite the most wonderful were the
            paintings of Duccio di Buoninsegna an early Sienese painter of the 13th century. I have
            never before seen any of his works – and in the novelty of the surprise I am almost
            ready to declare they are the mot beautiful things I have ever seen – certainly I have
            never seen more exquisite, sweet, religious entiment. A large Madonna with child and
            saints, and 26 little pictures illustrating the life of Christ. Afterwards we went into
            the Duomo, where was a large congregation and a monk preaching in the most energetic
            manner. We walked about and then went into the small and rich capel of S. Giovanni – an
            admirable Renaissance work – with a statue of John the Baptist in bronze by Donatello –
            a font by Jacopo della Quercia – and small frescoes by Pintoricchio and Baldassare
            Peruzzi – illustrative of the life of the Baptist. Then into the Library of the Duomo –
            a magnificent vaulted room, with enormous frescoes by Pintoricchio – rather crude in
            colouring but fine in treatment and perspective – with a superb collection of old
            Missals, some of them with exquisite miniatures by Liberali da Verona. Then across the
            street to the hospital of S. Maria della Scala – just after we had entered the handsome
            entrance hall a large company of the brothers of the Misericordia came in bearning a
            bier like stretcher with a sick person on it – and as they formed <pb n="65"/> in line and waited,
            they made quite a scene in their long black robes and cowls. The hospital looked very
            clean – and in the church was a beautiful organ with artistic brass work by Peruzzi. </p>

            Thursday – Grand Hotel </title></p>
            <p>We made rather an early start on Tuesday
            morning by rail, and arrived a Chiusi at 1:30 where we stopped for an hour, and had an
            excellent lunch at the station. We found two carriages waiting for us which had been
            sent over by Mme. Beccafumi – and had an enchanting drive here which we reached at 7
            o’clock. For an hour or two before reaching Perugia, our way lay around and by Lake
            Thrasymene, giving most charming views, and grew more beautiful as we reached this
            wonderful old town, lying so almost unapproachably on it mountain height – as we climbed
            backwards and forwards up to its great walls and fortresses, the sun was going down
            beyond the mountains above the great Umbrian plain and the cloud scenery was quite
            wonderful. Our hotel is very good – and our appartments quite palatial. The house stands
            on one of the highest parts of the town, commanding a widely magnificent view – with the
            picturesque town lying about and below us – what a scenery of roofs – campaniles –
            gardens and winding, climbing roads – with the wide plain far below – and range after
            range of mountain enclosing it – some of their peaks white with snow. Yesterday morning
            we went for a walk about the town – then to the Cathedral which is poor and
            uninteresting, but in the sacristy of which is a large painting by Luca Signorelli – <pb n="66"/>
            very lovely in tone and colour – with admirable figures. Then to the old Chamber of
            Commerce, where the walls are quite covered with paintings and decorations by Perugino –
            and the stalls and seats and panels are most beautifully carved and inlaid by Antonio
            Mercalello – the designs being quite exquisite. Then we climbed flight after flight of
            stone steps until we came to the top of the Palazzo Publico, where is the gallery of
            paintings – principally of the Umbrian school. Strange, quaint things most of them were
            – gathered in from churches and monasteries. In spite of their archaicisms many of them
            truly charming in sentiment and colouring – especially the “Adoration of the Magi” and
            the Madonna with angels playing on instruments by Benedetto Bonfigli – whose works I
            have never before seen – nor any of Giovanni Boccati da Camerino, who has a most
            delightful “Madonna col Bambine e Molti Angelic he cantano a altri Santi” – the choir of
            angels surround the Madonna’ throne in a semicircle leaning over a parapet – their
            golden heads and pink cheeks most charming, singing with all their might so that one
            almost hears their voice – little angels on either side the throne, one playing a harp –
            and the other dear a mandolin – above all a canopy of flowering trees. Now have I ever
            seen or heard of Fiorenzo di Lorenzo whose four panels illustrating the miracles of S.
            Bernadino are delightful in colour, action and sentiment – evidently painted from life
            in the streets and squares of Perugia. There was an Annunciation by Piero della
            Francesca, forming the upper part of a panel containing four saints, done evidently by
            other hands – figures in the Annunciation beautiful with fine architectural perspective.
            After <pb n="67"/> coming out these deadly cold galleries, the bright sun was quite blinding – and to
            put some warmth into us, we walked through the streets down to the old and picturesque
            Roman Gate, on it massive Etrucan foundations, now called the Areo di Augusto, with the
            inscription Augusta Perusia on it. I have long had a fine photograph of it. By the time
            we had climbed the stony street and reached our hotel I was almost dead with fatigue.
            Today the morning dawned dark and threatening, and it has gone on from bad to worse. We
            have all stayed indoors writing and grumbling. Among other letters Theodore wrote was
            one to Everard Fielding, which was taken out with others late into the hall and laid on
            the porters desk. Soon afterwards Basil Fielding came along, and seeing the letter
            addressed to his brother, went to the register to see who was likely to have written it
            – and seeing our names, sent in his card. We were delighted to see the pleasant boy
            again, and persuaded him and his friend, a priest, Father Forbes, to have lunch with us
            – and after a jolly lunch, and visit, they went out with Berenson to see some sights.
            They had come from Assisi this morning, and went back this afternoon – they are spending
            their Easter vacation at Assisi – and as we intend driving over there tomorrow (only 8
            miles) we have arranged to meet and lunch together. Basil is still at the Scotch college
            in Rome – and as rampant a young churchman as ever – we have been promoted today to a
            very charming apartment just vacated by the Dowager Duchess of Bedford – my room is at
            the corner, overlooking the great Umbrian plain, with the grand sweep of the Appenines –
            and I seem to be hanging in mid air. </p>

            <p><title>Saturday, April 20. </title></p>
            <p>Yesterday the rain poured almost continuously – only clearing for awhile in the afternoon when we took Nettie, who
            has not been able to do any sight seeing here, to the Sacristy of the Duomo, to see
            Signorelli’s beautiful Madonna, Child and Saints. The light was more favorable than on
            the other day – and we sat a long time in the quiet sacristy looking at it. What
            harmonious color! Then we went to del Cambio, and then Theodore got into the little
            carriage with Nettie and me, and we went to the charming church of S. Pietro di
            Casimenci, with no interesting pictures, but wonderful woodwork and intarsi – and an
            altogether interesting old basilica of the year 1000. Last night it rained as the femme
            de chamber expressed it “terriblement” - and all this morning the clouds hung about the
            valley and trailed along the mountain sides. But we ordered luncheon early, and
            determined to drive to Assisi – but at the last moment my courage failed, and then
            Nettie’s, and so we stayed at home, and were busy all the afternoon at one window or
            another watching the wonderful cloud effects, and the great marshaling of light and
            shade across the plain. The carriage came back about 7 o’clock with our poor people
            chilled and tired – for the weather has changed and it is cold. We are all ready for our
            start for Bologne tomorrow morning. </p>

            <p><title>Hotel Cavour. Milan. April 23. <title><p>
            <p>We left Perugia Sunday morning – the weather having cleared perfectly, giving us perfect views – changed
            cars at Tarantalo – and <pb n="69"/> got an excellent compartment to ourelves quite through to
            Bologne – the views as we crowned the Appenines on that bright day were fine – went to
            the Hotel Brun, where we stayed 9 years ago, and had the same apartment – grand but very
            gloomy. The next morning we went to the Belli Arti and saw some lovely Francias –
            Timeoteo Vitete “Magdalen”, Raphael’s St. Cecilia – a lovely Madonna by Cima. We spent
            most of the morning there, and then went to the Museo Civica, where we spent a rather
            unsatisfactory hour. In the afternoon we drove up to S. Michele in Bosco – a rather
            interesting and handsome church of the Olivetans – the monastery now changed into an
            Orthopedic Hospital with a beautiful view. On our way home Mr. Berenson took us to the
            San Vitale church to show us a beautiful Francia – an altar piece – two angels with a
            lovely landscape. We hould have left Bologna at 6 o’clock – but on reaching the station
            heard that our train was 40 minutes late – but the waiting was very amusing – for a
            number of church dignitaries were waiting for an incoming train which was to bring an
            eminence of Cardinal Archbishop, with numerous clerical belongings to attend an
            important meeting. He proved an amiable looking old man – and was most respectfully
            greeted by the crowd. We were late getting here – and were disappointed not to get our
            old rooms – the hotel is crowded – and so are the trains with tourists coming north – by
            the time our luggage arrived and we had our supper, it was not far from one o’clock.
            This morning we started out soon after breakfast for the Poldi Pezzoli, and spent an
            hour or more – then to the Ambrosiana – and home by one o’clock tired indeed. In the
            afternoon Theodore and <pb n="70"/> Berenson went to a private gallery to see some pictures, and then
            Berenson, Nettie and I got into a little open cab, and drove to S. Lorenzo, the eldest
            church in Milan – with remains of Roman buildings about it – and in the street near it
            are 16 Corinithian columns, which remain from an ancient colonnade. Then to S. Maria
            preso S. Celso where I went the last time – and we stopped for a few moments at the
            magnificent Opidale Maggiore – which is so vast that there are 9 courts in it. </p>

            <p><title>Milan – Friday, April 26 </title></p>
            <p>Wednesday was a gloomy day – and I was too wretched to leave the house.
            We went to Bergamo at 4 o’clock p.m. – arriving there at 5:30 – went to the Hotel
            d’Italia – and were decently comfortable – after we had ordered 3 big fires made in our
            rooms. We must have had all the god rooms of the principal floor – and the last entry in
            the visitors’ book was Nov. 24, ’94. My room was a big ghostly thing, which with a big
            fire became almost cheerful – and the curtains over my bed were presided over by a big
            holden goose. We all crowded into a big landau the next morning and drove to the church
            of S. Bartolomeo – where is a splendid fascinating altar picture of Lotto’s – a Madonna
            and ten saints – Mr. Berenson ordered down all the altar decorations so that we might
            better see the picture – and we stayed in the deadly cold little church, until we were
            petrified, looking at the delicious picture. In Berenson’s recent book on Lotto, which
            we have not yet seen, he reproduces the principal Lottos – so that I won’t try any
            description of those lovely pictures myself, but will better refresh <pb n="71"/> my memory in the
            future by reading his descriptions. Then we went to the S. Spirito church – and saw
            another great altar piece by Lotto, the Madonna with four saints with angels in a glory
            above. Then to the church of S. Bernardino with another altar piece of Madonna and
            saints – quite the most beautiful of all. Then we drove to the upper town and visited S.
            Maria Maggiore with the adjoining chapel of “Collogni”, most richly decorated – and the
            Cathedral, with superb tapestries, and wonderful serena and woodwork in the choir from
            Lotto’s designs. It rained quite hard by the time we drove back to the lower town. Mr.
            Berenson had arranged with his friend Signor Pichinelli, one of the directors of the
            Museum, and who is the owner of many good pictures, not only to show them to us, but to
            take us to the palace of the Moroni family , and to show us two or three other places –
            so that soon after lunch we again packed ourselves into the carriage or rather into 2,
            and drove to the Maison Pichinelli, a most charming house with superb grounds in good
            order. We were received most hospitably and talked our little French and Italian as best
            we could – and then Signor P. went with us to the Moroni palace, a magnificent house in
            the highest part of the old town – where in a splendid loftly room we saw two of the
            most splendid Moroni’s – which have never been photographed. One of a young man in a
            lovely harmony of red – and the other a most distinguished middle aged man in black
            against a gray background – the pose, character, colour, quite perfect. While we were
            looking at these, the Countess Loroni arrived, a charming little person, who did the
            honours of her house most graciously – and took us from one pretty room to another,
            filled with pictures and bric-a-brac. After that we went to the Roucardi palace, <pb n="72"/> a
            gloomy magnificent house – with interesting family pictures – then to the Baglioni house
            – still more gloomy, and damp – but with an excellent collection of pictures etc. – an
            especially beautiful Cariani, and some Guardis – the rain poured all the afternoon and
            evening. This morning we went to the famous Bergamo Gallery – a small gallery – but of
            exquisite quality – what treasures – and what a pleasure! The morning was beautifully
            clear and for the first time we saw the wide view from the upper town – we took a drive
            around the castle and were home in time for a hurried lunch, and off for the station,
            where we had to say a reluctant goodbye to Berenson, who had to go to Venice to join
            Mrs. Jack Gardiner for a day or two. We got back to Milan at 2:30 and Nettie, Mary and I
            drove from the station to the Brera, where Theodore afterwards joined us – and
            afterwards he and I went to the private house where he had seen two little Dutch
            pictures for sale, and after having another look at them decided to telegraph Berenson
            to buy them for him. We are all ready for our journey to Lucerne tomorrow. </p> 1894 – 1895 1
